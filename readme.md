This project is designed to provide developers interested in AI, but not familiar with it, with test-guided examples. You can understand use cases of application-level AI, such as RAG, embeddings, and other functionalities provided by the OpenAI platform, simply by reading the test cases.

### Examples written so far (to be added continuously)
1. [KoreanEmbeddingTest](src/test/kotlin/aibytests/openai/KoreanEmbeddingTest.kt): semantic similarity, search
2. [BasicRAGTest](src/test/kotlin/aibytests/openai/BasicRAGTest.kt): conceptual flow
